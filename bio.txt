Work
I worked as a product manager for a esports start up. working on their ecommerce site and managing their fulfillment and inventory operations. I recently quit so I could learn web development!

Hobbies
I really enjoy cooking, reading, gardening, and playing video games. Cooking especially as it gives me an excuse to hang out with friends and share something delicious!

Career Goals
After this class, I want to work as a UX designer that can also create functional code. I'd love to work for a company that's trying to make the world a better place! Mozilla, if you're reading this call me.
