<h1>Work</h1>
  <p>
  I worked as a product manager for a esports start up. working on their ecommerce site and managing their fulfillment and
  inventory operations. I recently quit so I could learn web development!
  </p>
<h1>Hobbies</h1>
<p>
I really enjoy cooking, reading, gardening, and playing video games. Cooking especially as it gives me an excuse to hang
out with friends and share something delicious!
</p>
<h1>Career Goals</h1>
<p>
After this class, I want to work as a UX designer that can also create functional code. I'd love to work for a company
that's trying to make the world a better place! Mozilla, if you're reading this call me.
